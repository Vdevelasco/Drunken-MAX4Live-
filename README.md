A random walk patch able to automate several parameters at the same time.

- Control on how fast it "walks"

- Different Step Sizes for more extreme/subtle modulation

- A filter to smooth the signal

- Offset and Scale for control purposes

- Jitter (just for fun)


It should work on max 7 and older versions of ableton. Feedback is always appreciated!
